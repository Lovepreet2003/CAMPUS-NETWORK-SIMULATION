# Campus Network Simulation â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer  

This project simulates a scalable campus-wide network designed to connect multiple departments and ensure secure communication.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Design a hierarchical network model for a campus environment  
- Implement segmentation and routing between different departments  
- Ensure reliable communication across the network  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- VLAN configuration for departmental separation  
- Inter-VLAN routing using a Layer 3 device  
- IP addressing with proper subnetting  
- DHCP for dynamic IP allocation  
- Basic security configurations (passwords, access restrictions)  
- End-to-end connectivity verification using simulation tools  

## ðŸ›  Skills Practiced
- Network design and topology planning  
- Cisco router and switch configuration  
- Subnetting and addressing schemes  
- VLANs, trunking, and routing protocols  
- Troubleshooting and verification (`ping`, `traceroute`, `show` commands)  

## âœ… Outcome
The simulation successfully demonstrates how a campus environment can be interconnected with efficiency, scalability, and security in mind. It provides a foundation for real-world enterprise networking.  

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use
1. Download the `.pkt` file from this repository.  
2. Open it using **Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.x or later)**.  
3. Explore the topology and test connectivity using simulation mode.  

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
- Implement ACLs for traffic control  
- Add wireless LAN controllers and access points  
- Introduce firewall and IDS/IPS for security  
- Configure redundancy with HSRP/VRRP
